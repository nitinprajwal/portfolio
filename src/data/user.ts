  about: `
Hello, World.

I'm Nitin, a developer who thrives on building things that scale from cloud-native microservices to AI-driven systems. My work spans across Oracle projects, open-source contributions, and developer communities like GDG, where I've led teams and shipped real solutions.

I enjoy working where AI, cloud, and distributed systems meet, turning complex ideas into efficient, production-ready code. Whether it's fine-tuning LLMs, designing high-performance pipelines, or reverse-engineering browsers, I focus on engineering with clarity, speed, and impact.

Always exploring, always building.
